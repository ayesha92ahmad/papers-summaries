<h1>Improved Recommendation System with Review Analysis</h1>

This is a paper by Ms. Vinaya B. Savadekar and Mr. Manoj E. Patil.

In this paper the authors talk about recommender systems and the different kinds of recommender systems that are present today. Most existing recommendation systems undergo the scalability and efficiency problem in processing data. The authors present an English language keyword list and domain thesaurus based personalized recommendation method.

Introduction:
1. Big data: datasets that are too big to capture, store, manage and analyse.
2. Recommendation systems provide suggestions of of items that a user might like. It helps users identify useful products in a mass of large number of products.
3. Current recommendation methods are divided in to 3:
   a. Content based - User's preferences from the past
   b. Collaborative
      - Item based CF - same user
      - User based CF - different users with similarity
   c. Hybrid - Mix of the two

Problem statement and objective:
1. Previous system suffers from scalibily and inefficiency problems while processing large amount of data.
2. Authors claim that the paper processes a novel method or personalized recommendation system:
          - Keyword lists are maintained for different domain.
          - Preference are taken from users.
          -

Why I like about this paper?
1. Easy to understand because it was very basic. 
2. Did not show me crazy mathematical equations( I will be moving to them slowly but initially I'd like to see simpler papers.

What I didn't like about this paper?
1. Too general. Explains the concept of recommendation systems more than their own project. 
2.
